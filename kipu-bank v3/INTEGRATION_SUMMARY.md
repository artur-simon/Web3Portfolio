# KipuBankV3 Integration Summary

## What Was Done

### Smart Contracts
1. **MockV3Aggregator.sol** - Mock Chainlink price feed for local testing
2. **KipuBankV3.sol** - Already present, fixed import path for Chainlink contracts
3. Updated Hardhat config to support both Solidity 0.8.19 and 0.8.20

### Deployment
- Created deployment script (`packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.ts`)
- Supports both localhost and Sepolia networks
- Localhost uses MockV3Aggregator with $2000 ETH price
- Sepolia uses real Chainlink oracle at 0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306
- Bank cap: $1,000,000 USDC
- Max withdraw per transaction: $10,000 USDC

### Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite (`packages/hardhat/test/KippuBankV3.ts`)
- 25 passing tests covering:
  - Deployment verification
  - ETH deposits (success, bank cap, zero amount)
  - ETH withdrawals (success, limits, balance checks)
  - Balance queries
  - Edge cases (reentrancy, direct transfers)
  - Admin functions

### Frontend
- Updated `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx` with Kipu Bank interface
- Features:
  - Display user ETH balance in bank
  - Show total bank stats (USD value, capacity, counts)
  - Deposit ETH form
  - Withdraw ETH form
  - Transaction status feedback
- Uses Scaffold-ETH hooks for contract interaction

### Cleanup
- Removed old YourContract.sol and its test file

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd "kipu-bank v3"
yarn install
```

### 2. Compile Contracts
```bash
cd packages/hardhat
yarn compile
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
yarn test
```

### 4. Start Local Development

**Terminal 1 - Start Hardhat Node:**
```bash
cd packages/hardhat
yarn chain
```

**Terminal 2 - Deploy Contracts:**
```bash
cd packages/hardhat
yarn deploy
```

**Terminal 3 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
cd packages/nextjs
yarn dev
```

### 5. Access the Application
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Deploy to Sepolia
```bash
cd packages/hardhat
yarn deploy --network sepolia
```

## Contract Details

- **Contract Name:** KipuBankV3
- **ETH Pseudo-address:** 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001
- **Bank Cap:** 1,000,000 USDC (adjustable in deployment)
- **Max Withdraw:** 10,000 USDC per transaction
- **Chainlink Oracle (Sepolia):** 0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306

## Key Features Implemented

1. ETH deposits with bank capacity limits
2. ETH withdrawals with per-transaction limits
3. Real-time USD price conversion via Chainlink
4. Access control for admin functions
5. Reentrancy protection
6. Comprehensive event logging
7. User-friendly frontend interface

## Notes

- The contract name is `KipuBankV3` (not KippuBankV3)
- Frontend will populate once contracts are deployed to a running network
- Debug tab in Scaffold-ETH allows direct contract interaction
- Block explorer tab shows all transactions
